IncidentFox is an **open-source AI SRE** that integrates with your observability stack, infrastructure, and collaboration tools. It automatically forms hypotheses, collects data from your systems, and reasons through to find root causes — all while you focus on the fix.

**Built for production on-call** — handles log sampling, alert correlation, anomaly detection, and dependency mapping so you don't have to.

## What is IncidentFox?

An **AI SRE** that helps root cause and propose mitigations for production on-call issues. It automatically forms hypotheses, collects info from your infrastructure, observability tools, and code, and reasons through to an answer.

**Slack-first** ([see screenshot above](#incidentfox)), but also works on web UI, GitHub, PagerDuty, and API.

**Highly customizable** — set up in minutes, and it self-improves by automatically learning and persisting your team's context.

---

## How We're Different

**AI SRE is not a new idea.** The problem? Most AI SREs don't actually work — they lack the context to debug *your* specific systems.

### Context Is Everything

Other tools ask you to manually configure integrations, write runbooks, and hope the AI figures it out. **IncidentFox does the opposite.**

On setup, we analyze your codebase, Slack history, and past incidents to understand how your org actually works. Internal CI/CD system with weird quirks? Custom deployment tooling? We learn it automatically and build integrations that work out of the box.

**No weeks of integration work. No building your own MCP servers.** We connect to the tools that actually matter for root cause — so you can skip straight to debugging.

### Slack-Native UX

We're opinionated: **you shouldn't leave Slack during an incident.**

- Upload a Grafana screenshot → we analyze it
- Attach a log file → we parse and correlate
- All tool outputs, evidence, and reasoning → visible as Slack attachments
- No new tabs. No context switching. Debug where you already work.

### Powerful Agents, Secure by Default

Our agents run in sandboxed environments with filesystem access — enabling code generation, script execution, and deep analysis. Security guardrails keep them focused on the task.

**The result:** Higher accuracy, faster resolution, less time wasted on integration work.

---

## Get Started

IncidentFox is **open source** (Apache 2.0). Choose the option that fits your needs:

| | Try Free in Slack | Run Locally | Self-Host for Production |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | See it in action | Evaluate with your infrastructure | Production deployment, full control |
| **Setup time** | Instant | 3 commands | 30 minutes |
| **Cost** | Free | Free | Free (open source) |
| **Privacy** | Our playground environment | Everything local | Everything on your infrastructure |
| | [![Join Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/Join_Slack-4A154B?logo=slack&logoColor=white)](https://join.slack.com/t/incidentfox/shared_invite/zt-3ojlxvs46-xuEJEplqBHPlymxtzQi8KQ) | [See below ↓](#quick-start-run-locally) | [Deployment Guide →](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) |

**New to IncidentFox?** We recommend trying it in our Slack first — no setup required, see how it works instantly.

---

### Quick Start: Run Locally

Get IncidentFox running on your machine in 3 commands:

```bash
# 1. Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Add your Anthropic API key (get one at https://console.anthropic.com/)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-api-key" >> .env

# 3. Start all services
make dev
```

**That's it!** IncidentFox will:
- Start all services (Postgres, config-service, sre-agent, slack-bot)
- Run database migrations automatically
- Load configuration from `config_service/config/local.yaml`

**Optional:** Add Slack integration for testing:
1. Create a Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps (enable Socket Mode)
2. Add tokens to `.env`:
   ```bash
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
   SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token
   ```
3. Restart: `make restart`

## Under the Hood

The engineering that makes IncidentFox actually work in production:

| Capability | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **RAPTOR Knowledge Base** | Hierarchical tree structure (ICLR 2024) — clusters → summarizes → abstracts | Standard RAG fails on 100-page runbooks. RAPTOR maintains context across long documents. |
| **Smart Log Sampling** | Statistics first → sample errors → drill down on anomalies | Other tools load 100K lines and hit context limits. We sample intelligently to stay useful. |
| **Alert Correlation Engine** | 3-layer analysis: temporal + topology + semantic | Groups alerts AND finds root cause. Reduces noise by 85-95%. |
| **Prophet Anomaly Detection** | Meta's Prophet algorithm with seasonality-aware forecasting | Detects anomalies that account for daily/weekly patterns, not just static thresholds. |
| **Dependency Discovery** | Automatic service topology mapping with blast radius analysis | Know what's affected before you start investigating. No manual service maps needed. |
| **300+ Built-in Tools** | Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, Grafana, Datadog, Prometheus, GitHub, and more | No "bring your own tools" setup. Works out of the box with your stack. |
| **MCP Protocol Support** | Connect to any MCP server for unlimited integrations | Add new tools in minutes via config, not code. |
| **Multi-Agent Orchestration** | Planner routes to specialist agents (K8s, AWS, Metrics, Code, etc.) | Complex investigations get handled by the right expert, not a generic agent. |
| **Model Flexibility** | Supports OpenAI and Claude SDKs — use the model that fits your needs | No vendor lock-in. Switch models or use different models for different tasks. |
| **Continuous Self-Improvement** | Learns from investigations, persists patterns, builds team context | Gets smarter over time. Your past incidents inform future investigations. |

## Enterprise Ready

Security, compliance, and deep customization for production deployments.

### Context at Scale

Every team is different — different tech stacks, observability tools, incident patterns, and services. Enterprise unlocks **deep specialization**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-Learn Your Org** | We analyze your codebase, Slack history, and past incidents to identify which internal tools matter most for debugging. Then we auto-build integrations. |
| **Team-Specific Agents** | Each team gets agents tuned to their stack. Your payments team and your infra team have different needs — their agents reflect that. |
| **Custom Prompts & Tools** | Auto-learned defaults, with full control to tune. Engineers can adjust prompts, add tools, and configure agents per team. |
| **Context Compounds** | Every investigation makes IncidentFox smarter about your systems. Tribal knowledge gets captured, not lost. |

### Security & Compliance

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **SOC 2 Compliant** | Audited security controls, data handling, and access management |
| **Sandboxed Execution** | Isolated Kubernetes sandboxes for agent execution — no shared state between runs |
| **Secrets Proxy** | Credentials never touch the agent. Envoy proxy injects secrets at request time. |
| **Approval Workflows** | Critical changes (prompts, tools, configs) require review before deployment |
| **SSO/OIDC** | Google, Azure AD, Okta — per-organization configuration |
| **Hierarchical Config** | Org → Business Unit → Team inheritance with override capabilities |
| **Audit Logging** | Full trail of all agent actions, config changes, and investigations |
| **On-Premise** | Deploy entirely in your environment — air-gapped support available |
